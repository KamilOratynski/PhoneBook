This is project which aim was to learn sorting and searching algorithms. The data input was a million+ list of Phone Book contacts ('directory.txt') in which the program searched for 500 contacts from 'find.txt'. Sorting algorithm are QuickSort. For the search we used: linear search, binary search. Last stage goal was to use a hash table.
